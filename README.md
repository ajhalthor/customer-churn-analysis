Sure, its certainly cleaner than what you'd find out in the wild. But that doesn't stop me from getting some interesting insights. Get the full scoop in this [notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/harshalnikose/customer-churn-modeling-analysis).

No point analyzing data if no one understands it. So I put together a more terse presentation slide deck. It's certainly much easier to present to "my team" at Telco. If has a more logical flow to it.
